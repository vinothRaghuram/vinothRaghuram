Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Vinoth
I'm passionate about working with data â€” analyzing, visualizing, and building data systems that create meaningful insights.
Iâ€™m currently exploring opportunities in Data Analytics and Data Engineering, combining my skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel to solve real-world problems.

I enjoy uncovering hidden patterns in data and building efficient pipelines that power better decisions.
Always curious, always learning, and excited to grow in the world of data!
